.. _hw-resolve-overview:

GDK Hardware Wallet Interface
=============================

This section details the format of data requests from hardware wallet
interaction during resolution of GA_auth_handler processing when
`GA_auth_handler_get_status` returns the status ``"resolve_code"`` with
a ``"required_data"`` element present.

.. _hw-required-data:

Required Data JSON
------------------

Returned as an element ``"required_data"`` of :ref:`auth-handler-status` when
data is required from a registered hardware device.

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "action": "",
       "device": {
       },
     }

:action: Describes the hardware wallet data requested.
:device: Contains the :ref:`hw-device` originally registered with the session.

Additional fields will be present depending on the action requested, as follows:


.. _hw-action-get-xpubs:

Hardware Get XPubs Action
-------------------------

When ``"action"`` is ``"get_xpubs"``, this describes a request to compute one
or more xpubs from the wallet's master key.

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "paths": [ [], [ 2147501889 ] ]
     }

:paths: An array of unsigned 32-bit integer arrays representing each xpub to
    fetch. The integer values should be interpreted per BIP32, i.e. the topmost
    bit may be set to indicate a private derivation in the path. An empty array
    indicates that the top level xpub should be returned.

**Expected response**:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "xpubs": [
         "tpubD8G8MPH9RK9uk4EV97RxhzaY8SJPUWXnViHUwji92i8B7vYdht797PPDrJveeathnKxonJe8SbaScAC1YJ8xAzZbH9UvywrzpQTQh5pekkk",
         "tpubD6NzVbkrYhZ4X9jwmpJxg1kjEJTQgkrnHNEWww2e86X1eUfWu1f7hZpgezAyWUk5zRt4fMPHB33CXrvJSYHHAoVMFXrfxpornvJBgbvjvLN"
       ]
     }

:xpubs: An array of base58-encoded BIP32 extended public keys, in the same order
    as the ``"paths"`` elements in the request.


.. _hw-action-get-master-blinding-key:

Hardware Get Master Blinding Key Action
---------------------------------------

When ``"action"`` is ``"get_master_blinding_key"``, this describes a request
to return the wallet's SLIP0077 master blinding key if the user allows this.

.. note:: This action is only returned when using the Liquid network.

No request data is currently associated with this request.

**Expected response**:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "master_blinding_key": "512cd6c0b73452a2414e9d86d37cdcc8283b44f0b6dd2b1eec23c59ff12b4f7e5949569b3430220dafce1e0e299a2a6f3fb3e62b2e8c860c82512cdf2d8b2fbc"
     }

:master_blinding_key: The 512-bit or 256-bit master blinding key for the wallet, hex-encoded.
    If a 256-bit key is returned, it should be the lower 256-bits of the SLIP0021 derived ``node``
    as specified in https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0077.md.

.. note:: If the user denies the request to share the key, an empty string should be returned.


.. _hw-action-sign-message:

Hardware Sign Message Action
----------------------------

When ``"action"`` is ``"sign_message"``, this describes a request to sign
a message using the given path.

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "message": "A text message to sign",
       "path": [ 1195487518 ],
       "use_ae_protocol": false
     }

:message: The message to be utf-8 encoded and signed.
:path: The path from the wallet's master key to the key that the message should be signed with.
:use_ae_protocol: ``true`` if the hardware device advertises Anti-Exfil support and it should
    be used for signing, ``false`` otherwise.

**Expected response**:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "signature": "304402207c673ef4255873cf095016c98c4982cea9a5133060b66a380f1bf3880e54f6c8022056fd731cbd44cd96366212439717a888470ed481628cba81195c557d5c4fc39c"
     }

:signature: The hex-encoded ECDSA signature in DER encoding corresponding to the given message.


.. _hw-action-get-blinding-public-keys:

Hardware Get Blinding Public Keys Action
----------------------------------------

When ``"action"`` is ``"get_blinding_public_keys"``, this describes a request to
compute blinding public keys from wallet scripts.

.. note:: This action is only returned when using the Liquid network.

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "scripts": [ "a91403f650e2434916d5b7f124de8f673442b696282887" ]
     }

:scripts: An array of hex-encoded scripts for which a blinding key should be generated.

**Expected response**:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "public_keys": [ "02045e92b8f68bd066180c05a39969f862a67f4efc8f5d7aeca32c627a463b8f27" ]
     }

:public_keys: An array of hex-encoded compressed public keys for blinding the given scripts.


Hardware Get Blinding Nonces Action
-----------------------------------

When ``"action"`` is ``"get_blinding_nonces"``, this describes a request to
compute blinding nonces and possibly blinding public keys for the given scripts
and shared public keys.

.. note:: This action is only returned when using the Liquid network.

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "blinding_keys_required": true
       "scripts": [ "a91403f650e2434916d5b7f124de8f673442b696282887" ],
       "public_keys": [ "035f242d49b88ca17948b156263e1f0c86d2cc9e9ff316b058dbbdb351e34bc9aa" ]
     }

:blinding_keys_required: ``true`` if the blinding public keys must be returned, ``false`` otherwise.
    Blinding public keys are not requested if the master blinding key has previously been given.
:public_keys: An array of hex-encoded compressed shared public keys for computing the nonces.
:scripts: An array of hex-encoded scripts for which a blinding key should be generated and then
    the nonce computed using the public key given.

**Expected response**:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "public_keys": [ "02045e92b8f68bd066180c05a39969f862a67f4efc8f5d7aeca32c627a463b8f27" ]
       "nonces": [ "8d940a5ec4ad122394cd2596ecfbf933a8d8fb0196015cc0a35399e3c326758c" ]
     }

:public_keys: An array of hex-encoded compressed public keys for blinding the given scripts.
    Must be present if ``"blinding_keys_required"`` was ``true`` in the request, and absent otherwise.
:nonces: An array of hex-encoded 256 bit blinding nonces.
