.. _hw-resolve-overview:

GDK Hardware Wallet Interface
=============================

This section details the format of data requests from hardware wallet
interaction during resolution of GA_auth_handler processing when
`GA_auth_handler_get_status` returns the status ``"resolve_code"`` with
a ``"required_data"`` element present.

.. _hw-required-data:

Required Data JSON
------------------

Returned as an element ``"required_data"`` of :ref:`auth-handler-status` when
data is required from a registered hardware device.

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "action": "",
       "device": {
       },
     }

:action: Describes the hardware wallet data requested.
:device: Contains the :ref:`hw-device` originally registered with the session.

Additional fields will be present depending on the action requested, as follows:


.. _hw-action-get-xpubs:

Hardware Get XPubs Action
-------------------------

When ``"action"`` is ``"get_xpubs"``, this describes a request to compute one
or more xpubs from the wallet's master key.

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "paths": [ [], [ 2147501889 ] ]
     }

:paths: An array of unsigned 32-bit integer arrays representing each xpub to
    fetch. The integer values should be interpreted per BIP32, i.e. the topmost
    bit may be set to indicate a private derivation in the path. An empty array
    indicates that the top level xpub should be returned.

**Expected response**:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "xpubs": [
         "tpubD8G8MPH9RK9uk4EV97RxhzaY8SJPUWXnViHUwji92i8B7vYdht797PPDrJveeathnKxonJe8SbaScAC1YJ8xAzZbH9UvywrzpQTQh5pekkk",
         "tpubD6NzVbkrYhZ4X9jwmpJxg1kjEJTQgkrnHNEWww2e86X1eUfWu1f7hZpgezAyWUk5zRt4fMPHB33CXrvJSYHHAoVMFXrfxpornvJBgbvjvLN"
       ]
     }

:xpubs: An array of base58-encoded BIP32 extended public keys, in the same order
    as the ``"paths"`` elements in the request.


.. _hw-action-get-master-blinding-key:

Hardware Get Master Blinding Key Action
---------------------------------------

When ``"action"`` is ``"get_master_blinding_key"``, this describes a request
to return the wallet's SLIP0077 master blinding key if the user allows this.

.. note:: This action is only returned when using the Liquid network.

No request data is currently associated with this request.

**Expected response**:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "master_blinding_key": "512cd6c0b73452a2414e9d86d37cdcc8283b44f0b6dd2b1eec23c59ff12b4f7e5949569b3430220dafce1e0e299a2a6f3fb3e62b2e8c860c82512cdf2d8b2fbc"
     }

:master_blinding_key: The 512-bit or 256-bit master blinding key for the wallet, hex-encoded.
    If a 256-bit key is returned, it should be the lower 256-bits of the SLIP0021 derived ``node``
    as specified in https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0077.md.

.. note:: If the user denies the request to share the key, an empty string should be returned.

    Must be present if ``"blinding_keys_required"`` was ``true`` in the request, and absent otherwise.
:nonces: An array of hex-encoded 256 bit blinding nonces.


.. _hw-action-get-blinding-factors:

Hardware Get Blinding Factors Action
------------------------------------

When ``"action"`` is ``"get_blinding_factors"``, this describes a request to
compute asset (ABF) and value (VBF) blinding factors for the given transaction
outputs.

.. note:: This action is only returned when using the Liquid network.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "is_partial": false,
      "transaction_outputs": [],
      "transaction_inputs": [
        {
          "txhash": "797c40d53c4a5372303f765281bb107c40ed9618646c46851514ff0483bee894"

          "pt_idx": 1,
        }
      ]
    }

:is_partial: ``true`` if transaction is incomplete, e.g. one half of a swap transaction.
:transaction_outputs: The transaction output details for the outputs to be blinded, in
    the format returned by `GA_create_transaction`. Any output with a ``"blinding_key"``
    key present requires blinding factors to be returned. When ``"is_partial"``
    is ``false``, the final vbf need not be returned. An empty string should be
    returned for blinding factors that are not required. It is not an error to
    provide blinding factors that are not required; they will be ignored.
:transaction_inputs: An array of prevout txids and their indices, supplied so the
                     request handler can compute hashPrevouts for deterministic blinding.

**Expected response**:

      ]
    }

:amountblinders: An array of hex-encoded, display format value blinding factors
    (VBFs) to blind the transaction output values. Any non-required values
    should be returned as empty strings.
:assetblinders: An array of hex-encoded, display format asset blinding factors
    (ABFs) to blind the transaction output assets. Any non-required values
    should be returned as empty strings.

       "transaction_outputs": [],
       "use_ae_protocol": false,
       "is_partial": false
     }

:transaction: The hex-encoded transaction to sign.
:transaction_inputs: Contains details of each of the inputs in the
    transaction, in the format returned by `GA_create_transaction`. Any input
    without a ``"skip_signing"`` key present and set to ``true`` requires a
    signature to be returned. An empty string should be returned for
    signatures that are not required.
:transaction_outputs: The transaction output details for the outputs to be
    signed, in the format returned by `GA_create_transaction`.

     }

:signatures: The ECDSA signatures corresponding to each input in the request, hex-encoded from the DER representation plus sighash byte.


.. _anti-exfil-request:

Anti-Exfil Request Data
-----------------------

Signing devices that advertize support for the Anti-Exfil signing protocol will
be passed ``"use_ae_protocol"`` as ``true`` in signing requests. When this occurs,
the following additional data will be present in the request:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "ae_host_entropy": "b18270b26905d7d76d8abac3fb0382af07239f1aeaec8daf8294a79b58e7877f",
       "ae_host_commitment": "61aafe4ca62cc8960687849089ae1a4b7698dcfb28842533a4417c870099167b"
     }

:ae_host_entropy: 32 bytes of host-provided entropy to include in the devices signature nonce, hex encoded.
:ae_host_commitment: The Anti-Exfil commitment to ``ae_host_entropy``, hex encoded.

For transaction signing, the above elements will be present in each element
in the ``"transaction_inputs"`` array of inputs to be signed.


.. _anti-exfil-reply:

Anti-Exfil Reply Data
---------------------

When signing messages using the Anti-Exfil protocol, signing devices must return the
following along with the signature:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "signer_commitment": "b18270b26905d7d76d8abac3fb0382af07239f1aeaec8daf8294a79b58e7877f"
     }

:signer_commitment: The 32 byte signer commitment to the nonce entropy for validation, hex encoded.

For transaction signing, a commitment for each input that was signed must be
returned in an array as follows:

.. code-block:: json

     {
       "signer_commitments": [ "b18270b26905d7d76d8abac3fb0382af07239f1aeaec8daf8294a79b58e7877f" ]
     }


Inputs that were not signed should have an empty string as their commitment array element.
